# Note At present, the plug-in is still being updated. If there are problems in use, you can use the Matlab version.
# LuckyProfiler
LuckyProfiler is an ImageJ plugin that uses the Projected-line FWHM resolution method to determine the image resolution of a final image. It is suitable for fluorescence microscopy images as well as super resolution images. It presents an effectively way for quantifying image resolution without overestimation and underestimation. For it calculates FWHM resolution along structures thus avoids human selection and is convenient for users. We think LuckyProfiler will be an easy and effective tool for helping researchers quantifying their experimentâ€™s resolution.
Methods and effects can be seen in the article: LuckyProfiler: an ImageJ plug-in capable of quantifying FWHM resolution easily and effectively for super-resolution images
